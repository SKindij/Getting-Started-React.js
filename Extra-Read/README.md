## ðŸ“– user authentication in React app

&emsp;Here are a few popular  tools and libraries:
* **Firebase Authentication:**
  - it is a fully-featured authentication service provided by Google;
  - it offers various authentication methods, such as email/password, social sign-in (Google, Facebook, Twitter);
  - it provides easy integration with React applications using the Firebase JavaScript SDK.
* **Auth0:**
  - it is a popular identity management platform that provides authentication and authorization services;
  - it supports various authentication methods and identity providers;
  - it offers comprehensive documentation and React SDKs that simplify the integration process.
* **Okta:**
  - it is an enterprise-grade identity and access management platform;
  - it provides robust authentication, authorization, and user management features;
 - it has SDKs and libraries available for React apps, making it easier to integrate authentication functionality.
* **AWS Cognito:**
  - it is a user authentication and authorization service provided by AWS;
  - it supports multiple authentication methods, including email/password, social sign-in, and more;
  - it has SDKs and libraries available for React apps, allowing you to add authentication to your app.
* **Passport.js:**
  - it is a popular authentication middleware for Node.js;
  - it provides flexible and modular approach to implement authentications, such as local username/password, social sign-in;
  - you can use it with frameworks like Express.js to handle authentication in your React appn on the server-side.

&emsp;Here are steps you can follow to implement custom user authentication system:
* **User Registration:**
  - Create a registration form where users can enter their desired username or email address, and password. 
  - On submission, validate the form inputs and store the user's information in your application's database.
* **User Login:**
  - Design a login form where users can enter their username/email and password.
  - Validate the form inputs, and then compare the entered credentials with the stored user information in your database.
  - If the credentials match, authenticate the user and grant access to protected areas of your application.
* **Password Storage:**
  - It is crucial to store passwords securely. Instead of storing passwords in plain text, use techniques like hashing and salting.
  - Hashing transforms the password into a fixed-length string, while salting adds a unique value to each hashed password.
  - This makes it extremely difficult for an attacker to reverse-engineer the original password.
* **Password Reset:**
  - Implement a password reset mechanism to allow users to reset their forgotten passwords.
  - This can be done by sending a password reset link or temporary password to the user's registered email address.
  - Upon receiving the link or temporary password, users can reset their passwords through a secure form.
* **Authentication Tokens:**
  - Once a user is successfully authenticated, generate an authentication token (e.g., JSON Web Token or JWT).
  - Include this token in subsequent requests from the client to the server to authenticate and authorize the user.
  - Verify the token on the server to grant access to protected resources.
* **Protecting Routes:**
  - In your React application, implement route protection by checking the user's authentication status and redirecting them to appropriate pages based on their authentication state.
  - You can use higher-order components (HOCs) or custom route components to wrap your protected routes and handle authentication checks.
* **Session Management:** 
  - If you want to implement session-based authentication, you can use server-side sessions to manage user sessions.
  - Store session data on the server and associate it with the authenticated user.
  - This allows you to track active sessions, handle session timeouts, and implement features like "Remember Me" functionality.
