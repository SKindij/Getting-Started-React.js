# Handling Events

&emsp;In React, you can handle user events using **event handlers** -- functions that are triggered when a user interacts with a component in some way, 
such as clicking a button or typing into an input field.

&emsp;To handle events in a component, you can define an event handler as a **method** on the component class. 
This method should be **bound** to the component's `this` context, so that it can access the component's `state` and `props`.\
&emsp;You can then pass this method as a **callback** to the appropriate **event attribute** of the element you want to handle the event for.
