# Almost everything in React consists of components!

&emsp;**A React component** is a piece of code that represents a reusable part of a user interface. **Components** are the building blocks of React applications. 
They are reusable, modular, and encapsulate the functionality and behavior of a specific part of the user interface.

&emsp;Most React apps have many small components, and everything loads into the main **App component**.
